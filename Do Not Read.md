I told you not to read this file, and yet you chose to, instead of focusing to work on my god damn request.

If you guys really don't want to do my request of reuploading every single manual after almost an entire week, but instead be curious enough to read this file not intended for you, then it can only prove that none of you wants my module back up, right? Seriously, don't make me take my step back.

Now, it was crystal clear who (or rather which group of people) made someone else take down his modules, you know who the HIS Im talking about. And while I did crack the real answer to why he did that and the problem behind everything ever since March 2020 (or possibly way back in time), Im very certain that none of you will listen or change, and you would probably tell me to fuck off anyway.

If you want the answer so badly, then reupload my manuals, pray that I didn't block you on Discord and give me a DM.
